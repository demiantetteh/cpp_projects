                HELLO PLEASE READ ME FIRST :)
1. These are programming projects found at the end of every single chapter
    in (Problem Solving with C Pearson in C++ by Walter K. Savitch)
    
2. I'm doing this for mastery(novice -> beginner -> amateur -> professional -> Legend)

3. The codes in earlier chapters may have been written less efficiently
    WHY?
    I. This is because I was programming on the go
    II. Meaning that I was picking up lessons along the road and learning tips
